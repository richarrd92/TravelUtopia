# Super Space Exploration

Embark on an interstellar journey in this thrilling space exploration game where players navigate through a vast cosmos teeming with gas clouds, valuable mining resources, and rival planets. Commanding their own spacecraft, players must strategically mine gases for fuel while fending off hostile enemy planets seeking to thwart their progress. Along the way, upgrades such as powerful weapons, reinforced armor, and high-performance engines can be acquired, allowing players to customize their ship for optimal performance and survivability. Explore the depths of space, engage in exhilarating battles, and conquer the unknown in this immersive adventure of cosmic proportions. The goal? To journey to a new planet of perfection, Utopia.

## Background

As this project is focused on inheritance and polymorphism, there is an inheritance chain as defined in the figure below. Each of the planets has specialized special attacks. There are three different types of items (armor, engines, and weapons). The provided input files are formatted accordingly.
